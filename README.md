# IMT-ML_Course_Projects
### The path I took to learn ML and DL in depth
These are the projects I've worked on during my first ever course in ML. As of now, I am aware of many of the flaws and imperfections that can be found throughout each of these projects, but re-writing them won't help others to see the way I've progressed during my journey in this field. Thus, I decided to share my projects intact, and the only change that I made on some of them, espcially first ones, is all the comments I added to help understanding my point of view at the time of doing each project.
