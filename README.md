# IMT-ML_Course_Projects
The way I've evolved as a machine learning engineer ... 
These are the projects I've worked on during my first ever course in ML. Now as an experienced ML engineer I am aware of many of the flaws and imperfections that can be found throughout each of these projects, but re-writing them won't help others to see the way I've evovlved during my journey in this field. Thus, I decided to share my projects intact, and the only changes that I made on some of them, espcially first ones, is all the comments I added to help understanding my point of view in the time of doing each of them.
